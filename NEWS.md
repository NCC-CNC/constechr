# constechr 0.0.0.9002

- New `rasterize_aoi()` rasterizes an AOI onto a template raster, onto
  coarser cells that nest in the template's, or onto a new grid at a given
  resolution (#14). `cells` (`"touches"` or `"centre"`) is required.
  `value` is `"index"` (the terra cell number in the template or coarse
  grid, the default), `"template"` (the template's own values) or a
  constant; `drop_na` drops AOI cells where the template is `NA` (the
  default); `crop = FALSE` returns the full grid. Decisions in ADR 0008. It
  replaces the rasterizing in wtw-data-prep2's `create_1km_grid()` (a 1000 m
  buffer, `terra::rasterize()`, multiply by the template, mask to the AOI),
  which gives the same cells as `cells = "touches"` on the test fixtures.
  Intended changes from that code: the cell rule is an explicit argument
  instead of a buffer and terra defaults, and an AOI that does not overlap
  the template is an error instead of an empty result.
- New `read_aoi()` reads an area of interest from `sf` or `SpatVector`
  polygons, a file (shapefile, GeoPackage, GeoJSON, `<gdb>/<layer>`) or
  bounds, with optional reprojection and dissolve (#13). It replaces the
  inline AOI reading in wtw-data-prep2's `aoi_to_grid()` and
  `create_1km_grid()` (`sf::read_sf()` then `sf::st_transform()`). Intended
  changes from that code: by default the AOI is dissolved into one feature
  without attributes (`union = TRUE`; `union = FALSE` keeps the features as
  before), Z and M coordinates are dropped, and the geometry column is
  always named `geometry`.
- sf and terra move from `Suggests` to `Imports`, with assertthat and cli
  for argument checks.
- Test fixtures (`tests/testthat/helper-fixtures.R`) and example files in
  `inst/extdata/` (a 10 x 10 template raster, an AOI and an rij matrix) for
  known-answer tests and examples (#11).
- Initial package setup.
